# OSDS-Rune

This is a mod for deltarune using the Kristal mod loader. It is generally a combination of all the ideas put together on the OSDS.

## Requirements
- Love2D
- Lua

You must do `git submodule init` first to initialize the submodules first. Then after the paths has been set, use `git submodule update` to clone Kristal.

After cloning Kristal to your system, use `love .` in the `Kristal/` directory to run Kristal.

## P.S.

To clone the mod to the `Kristal` mod loader, copy all the folders EXCEPT from the `Kristal/` folder to `Kristal/mods` to run the modification.
